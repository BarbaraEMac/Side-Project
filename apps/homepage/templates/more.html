        <h2>Pricing</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>How much is this Shopify App?</li>
            The App costs $0.99 for the first social button and $0.50 for each additional social button.
            
            <li>Why isn't this App free?</li>
            Since I'm hosting a website for this App, I have to pay some administrative fees. 
            I'm only charging a minimal fee so that I can continue to run this service.
        </ol>

        <h2>Social Buttons</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Why should I install this App?</li>
            Placing social buttons on your website will let your customers spread your
            products across their social networks. It's like free advertising for you!

            <li>Which buttons are included?</li>
            Here are the buttons that are currently supported:
                <ul>
                    <li>Facebook</li>
                    <li>Fancy</li>
                    <li>Google Plus</li>
                    <li>Pinterest</li>
                    <li>Tumblr</li>
                    <li>Twitter</li>
                </ul>
            <li>I want social site X. Can you include it?</li>
            Yes, please let me know <button><a href="/feedback"> here</a></button>!

            <li>Why are there spaces between some of the buttons></li>
            Most of the buttons have a speech bubble to the right of the button to display
            the number of times a page has been shared. For this reason, the buttons reserve
            some space on the right-hand side for the bubble to grow larger as more
            people share your products.

            <li>Can the spaces between the buttons be removed?</li>
            Unfortunately, no. The spaces cannot be removed because they are 
            enforced by the buttons themselves.
        </ol>
